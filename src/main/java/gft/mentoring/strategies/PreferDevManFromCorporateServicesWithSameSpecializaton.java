* Corporate Services separation by Specialisation
  @author(SÅ‚awomir Siudek)
  For Corporate Services there are too many different specialisations
  so Specialisation fields - which contains specialisations (like Finance, HR etc) is used
  to separate matching of mentor <--> mentee.
  In other words, if the person is from Corporate Services JobFamily
  we take into account matching by specialisation as required.
  An example: HR person can't be mentor for IT Support person even they
  are both from Corporate Services.*/
