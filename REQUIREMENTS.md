1.1. [JobFamily equivalent for Development](#1)
    (Sławomir Siudek)
    Some JobFamilies (called Development) should be neutral from Mentoring perspective, so
    Development group consist of:
    + Project Development
    + Architecture
    + Digital
    + Data

1.2. [JobFamily equality for Development](#2)
    (Sławomir Siudek)
    When you have Mentee from Development Group and two Candidates also from Development Group and only one of them
    has exactly the same JobFamily as Mentee, them Candidate should be prefferred DevMan over the second Candidate

    example:

    Mentee Job Family: Data
    Candidate1 JobFamily: Architecture
    Candidate2 JobFamily: Data
    As we see both Candidates are acceptable, but the second one should be preferred as the fiest Proposal as DevMan

1.3. [Corporate Services separation by Specialisation](#3)
  (Sławomir Siudek)
  For Corporate Services there are too many different specialisations
  so Specialisation fields - which contains specialisations (like Finance, HR etc) is used
  to separate matching of mentor <--> mentee.
  In other words, if the person is from Corporate Services JobFamily
  we take into account matching by specialisation as required.
  An example: HR person can't be mentor for IT Support person even they
  are both from Corporate Services.

1.4. [Mentor has company experience](#4)
  (Sławomir Siudek)
  Person who is hired less them one year can't be a Mentor.

1.5. [Mentor prefers the same localisation as his mentee](5#)
  (Sławomir Siudek)
  Matching process preferes the same localisation for Mentor and Mentee.
  Different localisation is not an obstacle in setting Mentor-Mentee relation, it is only
  not preferred.

1.6. [Mentor prefers the same specialisation as his mentee](6#)
  (Sławomir Siudek)
  Matching process preferes the same specialisation for Mentor and Mentee.
  Different specialisation is not an obstacle in setting Mentor-Mentee relation, it is only
  not preferred.

1.7. [Contractor can't be suggested as a mentor.](7#)
  (Sławomir Siudek)
  Only permanent employees can play Advisor/Mentor role in GFT. Contractors work as B2B model.

1.8. [Mentee prefers mentor with higher seniority](8#)
  (Sławomir Siudek)
  Seniority means time how long the mentor works in GFT company.

1.9. [Mentor marked as a leaver can't be taken into consideration](9#)
  (Sławomir Siudek)
  When we know that Mentor candidate is going to disappear in the near future
  we don't want to consider him/her as a valid candidate for mentoring role.

1.10. [Mentee prefers Mentor with higher level then mentee's grade.](10#)
  (Sławomir Siudek)
  It is accepted to have Mentor at the same level as mentee, but - if possible - mentor
  with higher level is preferred.

1.11. [Mentor can't have lower level than mentee.](11#)
  (Sławomir Siudek)

1.12. [Prefers mentor with lower number of mentees.](12#)
  (Sławomir Siudek)
  To make CM tree balanced, number of mentees is an important factor in creating CM tree
  so when you have two equal candidates for mentoring, lower number of mentees
  should take precedence.

1.13. [Minimum accepted level for Mentor role is L4.](13#)
  (Sławomir Siudek)

1.14. [Mentor with long job seniority is preferred instead of Mentor with higher grade.](14#)
  (Sławomir Siudek)
  Let assume X is Mentor, Y - Mentee. if Seniority(X)-Seniority(y)>3 years then Y is better option than
  trying to find next mentor candidate with higher grade.

1.15. [Mentor need to have longer job experience that Mentee.](15#)
  (Sławomir Siudek)
  Mentoring is based on company experience, so Mentor should have bigger
  job seniority in GFT than Mentee.

1.16. [Prefers older Mentor candidates.](16#)
  (Sławomir Siudek)
  based on some discussion with my colleague I assumed that we prefer older people
  as mentors - because they are more experienced
  I think experience starts at 30 and increased till 40

1.17. [Mentor accepts only some limited number of mentees.](17#)
  (Sławomir Siudek)
  Level 4 - 2 mentees
  Level 5 - 3 mentees
  Level 6 - 4 mentees
  Level 7 - 5 mentees
