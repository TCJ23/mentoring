1.1. [JobFamily equivalent for Development](#1)
    (Sławomir Siudek)
    Some JobFamilies (called Development) should be neutral from Mentoring perspective, so
    Development group consist of:
    + Project Development
    + Architecture
    + Digital
    + Data

  1.2. [JobFamily equality for Development](#2)
    (Sławomir Siudek)
    When you have Mentee from Development Group and two Candidates also from Development Group and only one of them
    has exactly the same JobFamily as Mentee, them Candidate should be prefferred DevMan over the second Candidate

    example:

    Mentee Job Family: Data
    Candidate1 JobFamily: Architecture
    Candidate2 JobFamily: Data
    As we see both Candidates are acceptable, but the second one should be preferred as the fiest Proposal as DevMan
